# Client-Server
• A client/server application via TCP/IP over IPv4 sockets built with C++.</br>
• Daemon listens on socket for client connection requests and each connection will cause the server to fork a child process to serve the client.</br>
• A client connects to the server and can send files, receive files, and get a summary listing of all the files present.

This program was made in collaboration with my programming partner in 
CSE111(Advanced Programming), an upper division C++ course at UC Santa Cruz.

Skeleton code was provided to us by our instructor Wesley Mackey. 
Our implementation of the code can be found in cix.cpp and cixd.cpp

Details about the program features and specifications can be found in the file:
